In order to build the actual app you need first to build all core files.
This step is normally needed only once and after an update of the core files.
This could be done with the following command:
```bash

```

## Build the actual app
To only compile the Chrome app run the build script with the following command:
```bash
npm run build-chrome_app
```
The build version will be compiled in the `dist/chrome_os` directory, together with all required packages and files.

## Build and run the actual app (testing)

```
This will automatically build and start the application on Mac OS, Linux or
Windows, if supported.
